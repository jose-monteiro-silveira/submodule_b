<p class="black-small-title">Peering Policy</p>

<p>
    We have a selective peering policy requiring a minimum of 500 Mbps of 
    traffic destined to or through your network. We welcome the opportunity to 
    engage in peering with responsible BGP speakers in an effort to improve the 
    experience of all users from our customers.
</p>

<p>Both parties must provide a 24/7 contact who can escalate critical issues in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>
    Interconnections should occur in mutual locations, with a minimal 2x 
    10G SFP+ Ethernet interfaces, and the interface capacity upgrades should 
    occur in a timely manner to ensure a high end-user quality of experience.
